# Home automation web application 
This project contains one server, responding to requests that are sending by clients to this server.
Both of the front and back end are written with the help of NodeJS. The front end will fetch the house information from the server according to the clicked button.

### Setup and run
You will need to have `node` and `npm` installed for the following commands to work.

### Server
First fire up the server, else nothing will handle/serve your requests.
* `cd server` In terminal go to root directory (containing app.js )
* `npm install` To install dependencies
* `node app.js` Starts up the server that is now listening on some port on localhost

### Clients
Now you can start your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
